## Case:
School asked me the question how can we make podcasts a lot more interesting for people who are Deaf. In particular one person:

### Marie
Marie van Driessche is Deaf. With a capital D, that means sign language is her native language. The assignment is to tune the podcast to her liking.

### Proces
How'd go? Check it my [weekly logs](https://github.com/gijslaarman/web-design-1920/wiki).

## Installation
Copy & paste:
```
git clone https://github.com/gijslaarman/web-design-1920.git && cd web-design-1920
```

That's all. This is build in vanilla js.
