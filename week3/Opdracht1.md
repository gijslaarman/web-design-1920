# Web design
For this course I will be designing a podcast experience for Deaf people. Podcasts are very audio intensive, and less focused on the visual aspect. Deaf people can't hear so they need the visual aspect a lot more to be able to comprehend of what's going on.

  ### Chatting with Marie
  So first we met with Marie through bongo, a web app for facetiming and presenting your screen. Everyone asked some questsions to get to understand the situation a little better.
  
  I barely needed to get used to the fact that there is a translator speaking. They did such a good job that it really looked like you were talking to Marie herself, a very cool experience (never did that before)!
  
  Some highlighters I picked up out of this conversation:
  - Marie's native tongue is dutch sign language, she is fluent in Dutch & English (as far as I could understand). She had no trouble reading texts. 
  - Sign language is a whole other language than textual. It would be the same as comparing Chinese with Dutch. Without being able to speak it you have to resort back to basic gestures that are universal. 
  - Marie uses an app called 'Tolk contact' when she needs to make a call. Being called is super annoying for her since she can't do anything with it. When she makes a call she uses the Tolk contact app who will be her voice and translates what is being said back to Marie in sign language with video.
  - Marie is just like us, only 'listens' to podcasts she is truly interested in. But they must truly capture her attention to read the transcript does she want to read it. 
  - She reads emotion out of people's facial expressions, they are very important.
  - Marie watches movies & series just like us, the only difference being she can't hear them ofcourse.
  - In movies she sometimes has a hard time distinguishing the different characters from each other, since the subtitles don't show who is talking.
  - If the subtitles are out of sync with the video it's super hard to understand what's going on.
  - Comic books are a good example in how you can express emotion/sounds better in a visual way.

### Best practices designing for Deaf people.
1. Keep the language clear and simple. Deaf people aren't native Dutch/English speakers. Writing simpler and clear language makes it easier to read. And let's be honest it makes it easier for everyone.
2. The use of close captioning is useful, but there are somethings that are only useful for the non hear impaired. Think of adding [whispering] or [LOUD] to the caption, it doesn't make much sense to someone who has never experienced such things before. Ofcourse this is still relevant to people who are using close captioning that are not Deaf or hear impaired.

### My challenge
So I'm going to choose one podcast and try to transform it more into a visual experience.
